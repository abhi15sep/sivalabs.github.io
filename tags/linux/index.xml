      <description>As I mentioned in my previous post Thinking of moving from Windows to Linux? I am moving from Windows to Linux. Setting up my development environment is a bit tedious because I have to hunt down the applications and execute various commands to setup. So I thought of make a note of them in a post so that it will be easier for me next time.
I am using Ubuntu/LinuxMint system so I am using apt-get to install, if you are using Fedora/CentOS you can use yum/dnf.</description>

      <description>While learning some of the Linux commands we may want to use SSH commands to login into a remote Linux system and we may not have a dedicated Linux system to play with.
In this post I will explain how I am using my Linux OS installed on VirtualBox to SSH from Windows OS.
1. Install openssh-server on Linux OS in VirtualBox sudo apt-get install openssh-server
On some Linux distros (ex: Fedora) the openssh server won&amp;rsquo;t start automatically.</description>

      <description>I have been using Windows operating system from the beginning. When I first started using computer Windows XP was the latest operating system and it was amazing. After few years I started my career as a Java developer and in my office also I have been using Windows only.
After few years Windows Vista got released and I suffered with it for few months and then Microsoft released Windows 7 which is the best Windows operating system IMO.</description>

      <description>I wanted to explore CentOS 7 Linux, so I installed it on my Oracle VirtualBox. Installation went smoothly ,but I had a hard time to install Virtualbox Guest Additions to get full screen. I thought of sharing the steps I performed so that it may be helpful for others.
After installing CentOS 7, before installing Virtualbox Guest Additions first thing we need to do is update system.
sudo yum update</description>

      <description>Like many people I started working with computers on Windows XP operating system. Even after starting my career as a Java developer I have been working on Windows for all my development activities.
Initially I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance(need) to work on Unix/Linux because we didn&amp;rsquo;t have access to any of production systems which are using Linux. After few years we got a new client for whom we need to do deployment also in QA/UAT environments which are all Linux based.</description>
