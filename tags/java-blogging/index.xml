      <description>I come across many blog posts from various sources like Twitter, StackOverflow etc and some of them are very helpful. Also, in day to day work I learn few new things, explore some new tools. Usually I keep track of this information using Browser Bookmarks and Pocket.
I thought may be this information could be useful for others too. So, I am going to share it weekly on my blog.</description>
