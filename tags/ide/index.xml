      <title>Getting Started with SpringBoot in Intellij IDEA Community Edition</title>

      <description>We can use Intellij IDEA Community Edition for working with SpringBoot applications as we don&amp;rsquo;t need support for configuring servers like Tomcat, Wildlfy etc and can simply run the applications by running main() method.
However, there is no provision in Intellij IDEA Community Edition to create SpringBoot application directly, the way it supports in Ultimate Edition.
We can go to http://start.spring.io/ and generate the project and then import into our IDE.</description>

      <title>NetBeansIDE and IntellijIDEA From The Eyes of a Long Time Eclipse User</title>

      <description>I have been using Eclipse IDE since 2006 and I liked it so much for various reasons. First it is open source and free to use. Eclipse looks pretty neat on Windows OS on which I work most of the time. Occasionally I tried to use NetBeansIDE (before 6.x version) and I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it because it&amp;rsquo;s too slow. And I never tried IntellijIDEA because it&amp;rsquo;s a commercial product and I am 100% sure that my employer is not going to pay $$$ for an IDE.</description>
