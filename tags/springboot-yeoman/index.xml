      <description>I have been working with Spring and SpringBoot for many years and I needed to create lot of Spring(Boot) applications for various reasons like blog posts, sample apps, book sample code and for my personal learning as well.

I know we have the most popular SpringBoot Initializer to create SpringBoot applications. But, it generates the application with only selected starter dependencies added and nothing more.</description>
