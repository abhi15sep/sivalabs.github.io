      <description>If you are working on Spring Boot then you most probably aware of Spring Initializer (http://start.spring.io) which is an online spring boot application generator. You can select the starters that you want to use and then generate the application.
If you notice that there is no SELECT ALL option to select all the starters. Who would do that insane thing of selecting all the starters for an application??!!???
But, i would like to have the SELECT ALL option for one single reason:</description>

      <description>If you face the vt-x is disabled in the bios error while trying to run Android emulator, here is the solution that worked for me.
Step 1: Enable Virtualization Technology in BIOS Go to BIOS Setup and enable “Virtualization Technology” option.
On my Lenovo laptop this option was already enabled, but still getting this error. I have disabled it and re-enabled it, then it is working.
Step 2: Install HAXM Installer from Android SDK Manager Start the Android SDK Manager, select Extras -&amp;gt; Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM Installer) and install it.</description>
